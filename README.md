## !! Important note !!
All source codes in this repo are **not production ready nor safe to use**. They are written **solely for the purpose of solving algorithmical and mathematical problems** on the Codeforces platform.
Functionality of these codes is decided exclusively by the testing process on codeforces. All of the published codes were accepted by the codeforces platform, thus considered functional (only for solving one specific problem).
